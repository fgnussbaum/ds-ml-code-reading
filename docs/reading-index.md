# Reading Index

_A guide for code-reading sessions: when to read which scripts in which order and why._

A few principles that guide the reading progression:
- Sessions follow a dataset/problem arc rather than clustering by method. Methods appear in the context of the problem they solve, which anchors understanding and trains the ability to transfer to unfamiliar techniques.
- Concepts sometimes appear before they are formally introduced in lectures. This is intentional: encountering a technique in context first, then revisiting it in the lecture or further contexts, deepens retention.
- Scripts may be  revisited across sessions as different aspects become relevant. Repetition is a key learning feature.

Question types reference the [Question Catalogue](question-catalogue.md).

## Suggested Dataset Sequence

### Tips: Restaurant Tipping Behavior

*A single waiter's 244 bills:  compact, interpretable, and rich enough to carry us from EDA through regression to clustering.*

Questions for this dataset are in [cases/seaborn_tips/QUESTIONS.md](../cases/seaborn_tips/QUESTIONS.md).

- [tips_01_eda.py](../cases/seaborn_tips/tips_01_eda.py): tip_pct distribution, categorical comparison, confounding, smoker-sex interaction
- [tips_02_single_feature.py](../cases/seaborn_tips/tips_02_single_feature.py): linear regression, gradient descent from scratch, OLS normal equation, data leakage, scaling
- [tips_03_all_features.py](../cases/seaborn_tips/tips_03_all_features.py): multiple regression, one-hot encoding, permutation importance, partial regression, deployment assumptions
- [tips_04_kmeans_segmentation.py](../cases/seaborn_tips/tips_04_kmeans_segmentation.py): k-means clustering, elbow method, silhouette score, segment profiling, demographic crosstab

### Penguins: Palmer Penguins Morphology

*Morphological measurements for 344 penguins across three species: a modern, richer alternative to the Iris dataset that carries classification from a simple baseline through trees, with real confounds along the way.*

Questions for this dataset are in [cases/seaborn_penguins/QUESTIONS.md](../cases/seaborn_penguins/QUESTIONS.md).

- [penguins_01_eda.py](../cases/seaborn_penguins/penguins_01_eda.py): distributions, correlation, Simpson's paradox, species-island confounding
- [penguins_02_modeling_baseline.py](../cases/seaborn_penguins/penguins_02_modeling_baseline.py): logistic regression, incremental features, macro F1, confusion matrix
- [penguins_03_modeling_trees.py](../cases/seaborn_penguins/penguins_03_modeling_trees.py): decision tree, depth sweep, tree visualisation, feature importance, random forest

### MPG: Automobile Fuel Efficiency

*392 cars from 1970–1982: multicollinear engine specs and a strong time trend make this a natural case for regularisation, and the moderate dataset size keeps bias-variance diagnostics clean and readable.*

Questions for this dataset are in [cases/seaborn_mpg/QUESTIONS.md](../cases/seaborn_mpg/QUESTIONS.md).

- [mpg_01_eda.py](../cases/seaborn_mpg/mpg_01_eda.py): numeric distributions, multicollinearity, time trend, suppressor effect, horsepower outliers
- [mpg_02_ridge_lasso.py](../cases/seaborn_mpg/mpg_02_ridge_lasso.py): Ridge and Lasso, three-way split, coefficient paths, alpha selection, leakage-safe scaling
- [mpg_03_bias_variance_decisiontree.py](../cases/seaborn_mpg/mpg_03_bias_variance_decisiontree.py): learning curves, validation curve, depth as complexity dial, CV vs single-split stability
- [mpg_04_bias_variance_ridge.py](../cases/seaborn_mpg/mpg_04_bias_variance_ridge.py): learning curves, validation curve, alpha as inverse complexity dial, comparison with decision tree

### Diamonds: Diamond Prices and Quality Grades

*53,940 diamonds graded on the four Cs (carat, cut, color, clarity): a large, highly collinear dataset that pairs a classic confounding puzzle (the cut-price paradox) with a look at how PCA and t-SNE recover price-relevant structure without ever seeing price.*

Questions for this dataset are in [cases/seaborn_diamonds/QUESTIONS.md](../cases/seaborn_diamonds/QUESTIONS.md).

- [diamonds_01_eda.py](../cases/seaborn_diamonds/diamonds_01_eda.py): price distribution, correlation heatmap, cut-price paradox, carat-price scatter
- [diamonds_02_regression.py](../cases/seaborn_diamonds/diamonds_02_regression.py): carat-only baseline vs. full one-hot model, leakage-safe scaling, coefficient interpretation, prediction diagnostics
- [diamonds_03_dimreduction.py](../cases/seaborn_diamonds/diamonds_03_dimreduction.py): ordinal encoding, PCA variance and price-colored scatter, t-SNE colored by price and cut
