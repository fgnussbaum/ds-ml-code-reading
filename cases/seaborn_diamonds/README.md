## Domain Context

Each row is one diamond listed by a retailer. The four "Cs" (carat, cut, color, clarity) are the traditional trade grading system: carat measures size, while the other three are quality grades assessed by certified gemologists. Physical dimensions (x, y, z, depth, table) are derived from measurement and are closely correlated with carat. Price is set by the retailer and reflects all four Cs plus supply and demand dynamics. A key puzzle in this data is the price paradox: lower-grade cuts sometimes command higher prices than Ideal cuts because larger stones tend to receive lower-grade cuts, so carat confounds the apparent quality-price relationship.

## Codebook

| Column | Type | Range / Values | Description |
|--------|------|----------------|-------------|
| `carat` | float | 0.20 - 5.01 | Weight of the diamond in carats |
| `cut` | category | Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, Ideal | Quality of the cut (ordered; Ideal is best) |
| `color` | category | D, E, F, G, H, I, J | Color grade (ordered; D is colorless / best, J is most yellow) |
| `clarity` | category | I1, SI2, SI1, VS2, VS1, VVS2, VVS1, IF | Clarity grade (ordered; IF is best) |
| `depth` | float | 43.0 - 79.0 | Total depth percentage: z / mean(x, y) x 100 |
| `table` | float | 43.0 - 95.0 | Width of the top facet relative to widest point (%) |
| `x` | float | 0.0 - 10.74 | Length in mm (20 rows have x = y = z = 0, treated as data entry errors) |
| `y` | float | 0.0+ | Width in mm |
| `z` | float | 0.0+ | Depth in mm |
| `price` | int | 326 - 18,823 | Retail price in USD |

**Target**: `price`: integer, $326-$18,823, strongly right-skewed (mean $3,933, std $3,989). A log transform yields a near-normal distribution. Raw price is modeled in the scripts to keep predictions in USD.

**Data quality notes**: 146 duplicate rows (0.3%); 20 rows with x = y = z = 0 (dropped in scripts). Outlier values flagged (|z| > 3) in carat, depth, table, x, and price.

## What You Can Learn Here

- Right-skewed targets and when to apply log transformations before or after modeling
- Multicollinearity among carat and the three physical dimensions (x, y, z), and how PCA collapses them onto a single dominant component (see `diamonds_03_dimreduction.py`)
- Ordinal encoding trade-offs for quality grades (cut, color, clarity) vs. one-hot encoding with drop_first
- The price paradox as a concrete example of confounding: naive groupby comparisons can reverse apparent effects

## Research Questions

**EDA**
1. What is the distribution of diamond prices, and how does it change under a log transform?
2. How does median price vary across cut, color, and clarity grades? Do higher quality grades always command higher prices?
3. Which numeric features correlate most strongly with price, and which groups of features are nearly redundant with each other?
4. Why do Fair-cut diamonds sometimes cost more than Ideal-cut diamonds, and which variable explains this reversal?

**Modeling**
1. Predict diamond price from carat alone using linear regression; evaluate RMSE and R2.
2. Add cut, color, and clarity as one-hot encoded features; quantify the improvement and inspect coefficients for the quality grades.
3. Compare the carat-only baseline to the full model: how much does adding categorical grading information reduce RMSE, and which coefficients dominate?
4. Diagnose the full model's predicted-vs-actual and prediction-distribution plots: where does it break down (impossible negative prices, heteroscedasticity at high prices), and why?

**Dimension Reduction**
1. Encode cut, color, and clarity ordinally instead of one-hot; how does the resulting feature matrix compare to the regression script's?
2. How much variance does the first principal component explain, and why does that follow from the multicollinearity seen in the EDA?
3. Does an unsupervised PCA/t-SNE projection, fit without ever using price, still align with price? What does that tell you about the dataset?
